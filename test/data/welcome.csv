Step 2,Set Up the Zapier Webhook,Create a Zap that triggers on new Stripe payment ‚Üí sends payment info to this sheet's Payments tab (columns: Date, Client Email, Amount, Method, Notes). This kicks off automation.,
Step 3,Add Your Legal Team,In the Lawyers tab, enter each lawyer's ID, name, hourly rate, email, and optionally a currency (USD, EUR, etc). This drives time tracking and email notifications.,
Step 4,Start Logging Time,Every task should be entered in the TimeLogs tab. One row per task: Date, Client Email, Lawyer ID, Hours, Notes. We'll do the rest.,
